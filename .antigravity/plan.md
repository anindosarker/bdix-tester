Create a bdix ftp tester app.

Features:

- HomePage: A test button that will start a new test and show the result.
- Ability to update, delete, edit, add to the ftp server list (Admin only)

Technical details:

- The app should use nextjs for frontend and backend
- Use mongodb database for the project. I have updated the env
- Use custom hook with react query and service files similar to the web-template project.
- Keep the service file logic for frontend and backend the separate so its neatly organized.

Ask questions if any. and share the project file structure first.
